# Threejs Demo

In this project, I created a cube with `THREE` js directly and two Icosahedron objects with `react-three-fiber` package. A super easy demo for beginners.

## Steps to create 3D

- Create a Scene
- Set up a camera
- Render
- Create Geometry
- Assign a material and color
- Add object to the scene
- Create animation (Optional)

## How to set up this demo project Locally

- Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/art-abdulwadud/threejs-demo.git`
- Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install all dependencies
- Finally, run `yarn start` or `npm start`

From here, you can practise with the code, making changes as you please.
